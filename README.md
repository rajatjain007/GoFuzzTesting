# GoFuzzTesting
This tutorial introduces the basics of fuzzing in Go. With fuzzing, random data is run against your test in an attempt to find vulnerabilities or crash-causing inputs. Some examples of vulnerabilities that can be found by fuzzing are SQL injection, buffer overflow, denial of service and cross-site scripting attacks.
